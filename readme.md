Node.js RC Transmitter
======================

Based off the function of a regular radio transmitter. Built for raspberrypi 256, client was surface pro IE10 (all I had available) so touch on other devices may not function as expected.

Raspberry pi serves website and client connects back to raspberry pi via websocket connection. Data is send 50 time a second, sent via websocket as Uint16Array(16) via a webworker.

UI updating is handled by utilizing requestAnimationFrame which produces smooth movement of ui controls and feedback.
